# Reverse dictionary

This is a project that is aimed to solve the problem humans face when trying to remember a word they know it's meaning.

This uses the power of machine learning trained on a huge corpus of words from publicly available dictionaries.

### How to use?

The user only has to supply the meaning in a way that is as detailed as possible, structured properly of course, and the model will return the words. Trust me that it'll be accurate enough to help you out.
